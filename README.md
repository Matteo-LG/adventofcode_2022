My Advent of Code 22's journey
This repo will contain my work for Advent of Code 2022. I won't be competing at 6AM to try to get on the leaderboard but will still try to get the good answers as fast as possible. Thus my code will neither be elegant nor optimized.

# :(

For the first 2 day I didn't time myself but did both in approximately 3/4 minutes.

| Day | First star | Second star | Comment |
|---|---|---|---|
| 3 | 5min51 | 5min25 |  |
| 4 | 5min54 | 3min23 | Lost time for the first star by forgetting to convert the inputs to integers |
| 5 | 15min10 | 7min19 | Really bad time bc of trouble dealing with the input for the first star and deepcopy issues for the second one |
| 6 | 3min35 | 1min02 | Lost time because I forgot 0th element in python is the first character and my answer was off by 1 |
| 7 | 28min51 | 8min58 | *Really bad* performance today, for the first star it took me a long time to understand the problem with my code : I didn't take into account the fact that multiple directories could have the same name :( For the second star I just didn't read the problem carefully enough. Two good lessons for the next days ! |
